ABOUT: Welcome to the commentary track!

const:ZORK-NUMBER: The number of the Zorks shall be two.
	(“Three, sir!”)
	Yes, but *this* one is Zork 2.

rtn:V-VERSION: Print the title, release, and serial number.
	This function is shared between all three Zorks, which is why it has code to print all three titles. The passages meant for Zork 1 and 3 were ignored when compiling Zork 2. (Skipped code is shown in grey.)

src:GVERBS-89: The TRS-80 interpreter set a special bit which told the game to change certain behavior for no-doubt-contractual reasons. For Zork 2, it adds the line “Licensed to Tandy Corporation”.
	For a complete list of “Tandy bit” behavior changes in Infocom games, [see this page|https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/tandy_bits.html].
